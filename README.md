# SST Photo Booth
My submission for the 2024 Term 1 Computing Project Task (Integrated Diploma Programme version)

## Context
### Goal 
You are to design a virtual photobooth for SST's 15th Anniversary, which takes place in 2025. This photobooth will not have any physical props. Instead, you should code a program that is able to recognise faces in front of a live laptop camera and apply virtual props onto and around the faces. 

### Role
You will take the role of one of the designer-programmers in the virtual photobooth team for SST's 15th Anniversary.

### Audience
You will pitch your ideas for the virtual photobooth to the main 15th Anniversary organising committee, which comprises of the school principal, vice-principals and teachers in charge of the celebration programme.

### Situation
SST is expected to hold a ceremony for its 15th Anniversary. Students, parents and staff, both past and present, will be invited to take a walk down memory lane to reminiscence how SST has grown in the last 15 years. Notable guests, such as industry partners, will also be invited. As part of the celebrations, the main organising committee would like to have a virtual photobooth so attendees may take a photo with their friends and have a souvenir to remember the event by.

### Product
The virtual props for the photobooth should be designed to be suitable for the occasion. The virtual photobooth is meant for use by students, alumni, staff, parents and guests at the 15th Anniversary celebration. You may consider writing your program such that attendees of the event to choose can which virtual props they would like to have.

## Scenes + Explanation
This is copied from the report

My proposed virtual photo booth for SST’s 15th Anniversary focuses on resurfacing as many iconic memories of SST as possible.

The photo booth contains 4 “scenes”, which the user will be able to switch between.
A sunglasses prop scene. This relates to me, since I always wear sunglasses in SST and there are a lot of people that recognise me by them.
A “pondstar” filter. SST’s pond tends to have people occasionally fall into them, and most SST students have either experienced, seen, or heard of such occasions, dubbing the unfortunate victims “pondstars”. This filter places the heads of the users into the SST pond, making it seem like they have fallen into the pond.
A “gray wall” filter. SST has an iconic gray wall that people take photos in front of. As a photo booth, having a well known physical photo taking location inside would be interesting for users.
A “medals” filter. The 12th batch of SST saw the inception of the DC board, and the recognition of INC leadership. As a result, our batch has the unique attribute where it is possible for members to obtain up to 6 leadership positions (class, SC/PSB/ACE, DC, House, CCA, INC). This filter likens this to the numerous medals worn by certain military generals.

Overall, I believe these scenes are best fit for a 15th Anniversary SST photo booth, able to resurface and capture memories, iconic moments, and inside jokes within the SST community and the recently graduated batch.
